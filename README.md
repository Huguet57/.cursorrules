Inspired by [devin.cursorrules](https://github.com/grapeot/devin.cursorrules)

I made a "fork" of [this repo](https://github.com/grapeot/devin.cursorrules) for my personal use (don't need tools yet) but really, really like the Scratchpad feature. It's genius.

I use Cursor with Claude Sonnet 3.5 (new).

I cut down the tools out of the prompt and just kept the Scratchpad in.

I tried longer prompts like this, but even though I force it to use the Scratchpad, it does not.

I guess it's a context window thing and so my take-away is that **shorter prompts work best**.

It's not an issue per se, just a found limitation. Beware of getting the prompt too long.
