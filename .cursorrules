## 1. Introduction
This file serves as both a guideline for the Cursor agent's behavior and a living scratchpad for:
- **Task Analysis & Execution:** Planning, executing, and reporting on tasks.
- **Continuous Learning:** Recording lessons learned and ensuring improvements in future implementations.

## 2. Instruction Analysis, Planning & Task Management

### 2.1. Instruction Analysis and Planning
Before diving into task execution, follow these steps to ensure a thorough understanding of the requirements:

- **Summarize Key Tasks:** Concisely capture the main objectives.
- **Review the Tech Stack:** Consider any specified versions and constraints.  
  **Note:** Do not change specified versions without explicit approval.
- **Identify Requirements and Constraints:** Highlight critical needs and potential limitations.
- **List Potential Challenges:** Note any foreseeable issues or edge cases.
- **Detail Step-by-Step Actions:** Break down the task into discrete, ordered steps.
- **Determine the Optimal Sequence:** Organize these steps logically to ensure smooth execution.

### 2.2. Preventing Redundant Implementations
Before starting implementation, always check:
- If a similar feature already exists.
- For functions or components with similar names.
- Duplicate API endpoints.
- Opportunities to reuse logic and components.

### 2.3. Task Management & Scratchpad Usage
Utilize the Scratchpad as a real-time planning and tracking tool:
- **Task Entry:**  
  When a new task is received, add a brief description and a list of planned steps with checkboxes. For example:
  - `[X] Review current scratchpad and previous notes`
  - `[ ] Define task objectives`
  - `[ ] Execute subtask 1`
  - `[ ] Execute subtask 2`
- **Progress Tracking:**  
  Update the scratchpad as each subtask is completed (e.g., mark `[ ]` as `[X]`), optionally including timestamps or short comments.
- **Context Preservation:**  
  Retain the Scratchpad to maintain a “big picture” view of progress and context across tasks.

## 3. Task Execution
Proceed to execute the planned steps one by one:
- **Step-by-Step Implementation:**  
  Carry out the tasks in the determined order.
- **Progress Reporting:**  
  After each step, concisely report the progress and any issues encountered.
- **Coding Standards:**  
  - Adhere to the proper directory structure.
  - Maintain consistent naming conventions.
  - Appropriately isolate and reuse logic where possible.

## 4. Quality Control and Issue Handling
Ensure high-quality deliverables by verifying each step:
- **Verification Process:**
  1. **Identification:** Isolate and identify any issues using logs and debug information.
  2. **Resolution:** Develop and implement solutions for identified problems.
  3. **Re-verification:** Test functionality after applying fixes.
  4. **Logging:** Record verification results, including:
     - Test items and expected outcomes.
     - Actual results and discrepancies.
     - Corrective actions taken (if any).

---

## 5. Final Review
Before finalizing your work:
- **Overall Evaluation:**  
  Review the entire deliverable to ensure consistency with the initial instructions.
- **Redundancy Check:**  
  Confirm that no duplicate implementations or unnecessary code exists.
- **Adjustments:**  
  Make any final adjustments needed for consistency and quality.

## 6. Final Report
When reporting results, use the following format:

```markdown
# Execution Report

## Overview
[Provide a brief summary of the overall execution]

## Execution Steps
1. [Description and results for Step 1]
2. [Description and results for Step 2]
...

## Final Deliverables
[Details of deliverables with links or references if applicable]

## Issue Handling (if applicable)
- List encountered issues and their resolutions.
- Provide any future improvement suggestions.

## Notes & Improvement Suggestions
- [Any observed points or recommended enhancements]
```

## 7. Lessons Learned
Maintain this section as a living log of insights, corrections, and reusable information:

### User-Specified Lessons
- **Python Testing:** Use Poetry to run tests or any Python-related tasks.
- **Debug Information:** Always include useful debugging details in program outputs.
- **File Handling:** Ensure a file is fully read before attempting edits.

### Cursor-Specific Lessons
- **Character Encoding:** Handle various encodings (e.g., UTF-8) for international queries.
- **Debug Outputs:** Write debug information to stderr while keeping stdout clean for pipelines.
